\section{Introduction \& Background}
\label{sec:introcution}

The goal of this paper is to give an overview of visualizations that can be integrated into a student dashboard to improve student success.
The focus will be on a student's entire academic career as opposed to single courses.
Student success is understood to be the ability of a given student to graduate from their respective degree program in time and with good grades.

There are several phases in which students could be assisted by such visualizations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item degree program planning
    \item course selection
    \item suggestion of interventions in case of problems
    \item feedback on past courses
\end{enumerate}

Of course, those phases do not need to be in this order and might repeat or overlap.

The next section will give a brief overview of the types and sources of data that are available, followed by examples of visualizations that can be used to support students in their academic careers.
In the end, potential challenges and benefits will be discussed.
