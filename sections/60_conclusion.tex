\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has given an overview over visualizations that can be integrated into a student dashboard to improve student success. The focus was on visualizations that can help students plan their entire academic career and adapt to changes if necessary. The visualizations can be broken down into four categories: degree program planning and course selection, success prediction, trajectory and comparisons with other students. The paper also discussed the availability of data, potential challenges and benefits of such a dashboard.
Potential for future work lies in the implementation of such a dashboard, especially in the evaluation of its effectiveness with regard to increasing the motivation of students to perform as well as possible. There could also be value in creating new visual methods for selecting courses, taking into account the workload and prerequisites of the courses.
