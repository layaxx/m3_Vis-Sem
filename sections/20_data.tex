\section{Available Data}
\label{sec:data}

One key question of course is which kinds of data is available and from which sources. In the following, there will be a brief overview of the data sources that are generally available, with a focus on the local situation at University of Bamberg.

In general, there are two kinds of data: direct data and derived data. Direct data is data that can be collected directly and usually is already available, such as the grades of a student, specifications of degree programs, results of mid-term evaluations or the interaction of a given student with published course material.

Derived data is data that can be generated from direct data, such as estimated difficulty of exams, pass rates, estimated trajectory of a student (if and when they will finish their degree), or the estimated workload of a student.
